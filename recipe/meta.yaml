  summary: 'Real-time monitoring of x-ray imaging experiments'
  description: |
    OM (OnDA Monitor) is a framework for the development of programs
    that can monitor x-ray imaging experiments in real-time. It is
    also a set of ready-to-use monitoring programs. It is the
    spiritual successor of the OnDA Project and it is maintained
    mostly by the same team of developers. OM offers a set of stable
    and efficient real-time monitoring programs for the most common
    types of x-ray imaging experiments. These can be used immediately
    without modifications or can be easily adapted to meet the usersâ€™
    requirements. In addition, the project provides a set of modules
    that can be used to easily develop other monitoring programs,
    tailored to the characteristics of specific experiments.
